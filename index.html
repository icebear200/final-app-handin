                </h3>
                <p> Revolve allowed users to sort and filter on almost every attribute which allowed users to come 
                    up with specified options. Expedia and Shein both included a wide range of sorting and filtering options
                     and all three sites included a choice to aggregate with a wishlist and or shopping cart. The most helpful was allowing users to sort by popularity/ratings 
                     as well as price. The most helpful filtering was allowing users to filter by category such as dress/top for Revovle and Shein or apartment/hotel for Expedia. All sites had multiple sorting/filtering 
                     criteria which made sorting and filtering not mutually exclusive, an attirbute I'd like to implement. Additionally, all sites allowed users to filter by multiple attributes. 
                     Though this helps display options that match the filtering criteria, it seems a bit redundant and takes away from the point of filtering if the filter options display products that satisfy multiple criteria because it makes the outcome less specific. I liked how Shein and Revolve allowed 
                    users to clear/reset individual filters and also had the option to clear all filters.  </p>

        <div> <h3> Implementation </h3>
            <p> 
                Include a few sentences about the intention of your app and how you are incorporating filter, sort, and aggregation using your theme. </p>

              <p> I wanted to create an app that allowed users to organize their music. Often times my playlists can get disorganized and overflowed because I add so many different songs I like to one playlist over time. I want to organize my playlist by filtering by artist and genre and sorting by song titles alphabetically. I also want to create an add-to-favorites option where the songs I like the most in a playlist are added to a list on the screen. Users can add and remove songs from their favorite lists.
                </p>

                <p>At least 2 filtering categories that work as expected:
                    Users can filter by artist and genre </p>
                  <p>   At least 1 sorting category that works as expected:
                    Sort songs alphabetically by song title
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Includes a way to reset filters and sorts:
                    Reset button allows users to reset the page 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Includes an aggregator whose total updates when users add or remove items:
                    Users can add their favorite songs to a favorite songs list which tells them how many minutes of music in total theyâ€™ve listened to their favorite music for.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Includes at least 12 Item cards with all required parts (i.e: image, name, button, etc.)
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Filter & sort are compatible and work in combination:
                    Users can filter by genre or artist and then can sort the options alphabetically by song title
                    </p>
